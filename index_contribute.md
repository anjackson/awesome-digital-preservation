* Publish your data - Analyse, share your data, evaluate and improve
* In order to improve our digital preservation capability, we need to be able to analyse and evaluate our work in an effective manner. For example, we need to be able to compare and contrast tools and approaches, and we need to see how changes over time affect performance. Practising what we preach in this field means sharing our data about digital preservation. [Dave Tarrant explains why this is a good idea](http://openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2012-08-29-years-registry-why-has-preservation-community-not-solved-problem-well-managed-and).
* [Share your digital preservation data using the Linked Data Simple Storage Specification](http://www.lds3.org/)
* Some problems in this field require new tools or approaches that can be developed now. Others require research and experimentation before they can be realised as practical solutions. Enable Computer Science researchers (and other disciplines) to target your research challenge by making a contribution to the DP Research Challenges Wiki.
