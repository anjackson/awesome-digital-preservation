* Publish your data - Analyse, share your data, evaluate and improve
* In order to improve our digital preservation capability, we need to be able to analyse and evaluate our work in an effective manner. For example, we need to be able to compare and contrast tools and approaches, and we need to see how changes over time affect performance. Practising what we preach in this field means sharing our data about digital preservation. [Dave Tarrant explains why this is a good idea](http://openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2012-08-29-years-registry-why-has-preservation-community-not-solved-problem-well-managed-and).
