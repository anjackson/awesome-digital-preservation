Share or create digital object samples - Improving our digital preservation toolsets requires careful testing and evaluation of their performance. Sample data enables tool developers to easily try out their tools, discover bugs, and hone their tools ready for others to use. A test corpus can contain real digital objects from a collection, or be created specifically for exhibiting certain characteristics for testing purposes. Real data, particularly with examples of broken, badly formed or corrupted files can be particularly useful. For example, see this [JP2k test corpus](https://github.com/openplanets/format-corpus/tree/master/jp2k-test).

Some problems in this field require new tools or approaches that can be developed now. Others require research and experimentation before they can be realised as practical solutions.
