We need you to help us build Digipres Commons. All of the resources hosted or linked to from Digipres can be edited by you. Simply navigate to the resource you're interested in, sign up for an account and start making your contributions. A great place to start is the [DP Question and Answer Site](http://qanda.digipres.org/).

Digipres Commons itself can be edited by you, so please contribute links to other community resources if there is something important that we've missed. The Commons is built on [Github, so it's easy to edit](https://github.com/digipres/digipres.github.io)...

If you have any questions, you can discuss them with the Digipres Commons community [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/digipres).

We will be organising various community events which will be about continuing to build these digital preservation resources, so watch this space.
