# Contribution Guidelines

This Awesome List is not intended to be wholly comprehensive, but to link out to other more comprehensive resources.  The goal is to get people started, and to emphasis community-owned resources.

The scope is also limited to digital preservation. Digitization is not in scope, and in general for web archiving we defer to the [Awesome Web Archiving List](https://github.com/iipc/awesome-web-archiving).

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- The pull request should have a meaningful title and include a link to the package / resource and why it's awesome.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[resource](link) - Description by [Author](link to author)`
- Use [title-casing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case) (AP style).
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories, or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital.
- Check your spelling and grammar.

Thank you for your suggestions!
