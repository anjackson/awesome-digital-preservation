The Community Owned digital Preservation Tool Registry, <a href="http://coptr.digipres.org/">COPTR</a> has unified five isolated tool registries. It provides an easy-to-edit wiki interface where we can share our knowledge about, and experiences with, tools used for digital preservation purposes. If you create a new digipres tool, please [add it to COPTR](http://coptr.digipres.org/Guidelines_for_contributing_to_COPTR), but before you create a new tool, please use COPTR to find [similar ones](http://coptr.digipres.org/Category:Function) and see if you might be able to [extend or improve some of the existing tools]({{ site.baseurl }}/improving-our-tools/).

Digital preservation needs high-quality tools, but to get high-quality tools, we need <a href="{{ baseurl }}/test-corpora/">rich and varied test corpora to stretch those tools to their limits</a>.
