Save Digital Stuff Right Now
----------------------------

What about all the digital data at risk that doesn't fall within the remit of established GLAM institutions?

* Save web pages via [Internet Archive Nominations](http://blog.archive.org/2013/10/25/fixing-broken-links/#save_page)
* Alert the [Archive Team](http://archiveteam.org/), and [help them save digital stuff](http://archiveteam.org/index.php?title=Who_We_Are)


Preserve Your Own
-----------------

* The [Getting Started chapter of the Digital Preservation Handbook](http://handbook.dpconline.org/getting-started) is a great place to start.
* Build your roadmap, guided by [the NDSA Levels of Digital Preservation](http://ndsa.org/activities/levels-of-digital-preservation/)
* Use the [Digital Preservation Business Case Toolkit](http://wiki.dpconline.org/index.php?title=Digital_Preservation_Business_Case_Toolkit) to help get funding.
* Understanding your costs can help to plan your preservation work more effectively. The [Curation Costs Exchange](http://www.curationexchange.org/) allows you to compare your costing data with that of many other organisations.
* Share your [challenges and solutions](http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/REQ/Digital+Preservation+and+Data+Curation+Requirements+and+Solutions) with the community, and view the resulting record of digital preservation practice.
* Engage Stakeholders:
    * Visual examples of digital preservation challenges, such as graphic corruption, can be incredibly useful in communicating the digital preservation message. That's why we built the Atlas of Digital Damages [Gallery](http://www.flickr.com/groups/2121762@N23/) and [website](http://www.atlasofdigitaldamages.info). [Add an image of aÂ digital preservation challenge, failed rendering, encoding damage, corrupt data, or visual evidence documenting to the Atlas of Digital Damages.](http://www.flickr.com/groups/2121762@N23/)
    * Use the [POWRR One Pagers](http://powrr-wiki.lib.niu.edu/index.php/One_Pagers_tailored_to_educate_different_professionals) to educate stakeholders about the issues.
* Working with your IT department

Explore Questions, Issues and Evidence
======================================

Advance digital preservation by pooling our experience, sharing our war stories and finding the answers to the big questions.

* Discuss preservation issues on the [Digital Curation](https://groups.google.com/forum/forum/digital-curation) forum
* Share war stories on [OPF](http://openpreservation.org/knowledge/blogs/) blogs
* Discussion [forums](https://groups.google.com/forum/forum/digital-curation) and active [blogs](http://openpreservation.org/knowledge/blogs/) provide the opportunity to share informal advice and war stories, get recommendations and discuss the finer points of digital preservation. By sharing both your intentions for digital preservation work and your results, you can [ensure your work benefits from a wealth of community experience](http://openpreservation.org/blogs/2012-05-17-do-others-share-your-digital-preservation-challenges-and-know-about-best-solutions).
* In order to improve our digital preservation capability, we need to be able to analyse and evaluate our work in an effective manner. For example, we need to be able to compare and contrast tools and approaches, and we need to see how changes over time affect performance. Practising what we preach in this field means sharing our data about digital preservation. [Share your digital preservation data using the Linked Data Simple Storage Specification](http://www.lds3.org/). [Dave Tarrant explains why this is a good idea](http://openpreservation.org/blogs/2012-08-29-years-registry-why-has-preservation-community-not-solved-problem-well-managed-and).
* For material that describes the broader issues, you can refer to [Digital Preservation on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation), and consider contributing to the [Digital Preservation Wikipedia Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Digital_Preservation).


Real Data and Requirements
--------------------------

Real data, real challenges and real requirements make your and others digital preservation developments far more useful and effective.

* Test tools using publicly-available [test corpora](/real-data/).
* Add your files to the [OPF Format Corpus](https://github.com/openpreserve/format-corpus)
* Contribute to the [DP Requirements and Solutions wiki](http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/REQ/Digital+Preservation+and+Data+Curation+Requirements+and+Solutions)

Tools
-----

Software tools give us the means the interrogate, manipulate, understand and ultimately preserve our digital data.

* Find tools to solve your challenges with the [POWRR Tools Grid](http://www.digipres.org/tools/)
* Contribute your experiences of using tools to the [COPTR wiki](http://coptr.digipres.org/)
    * The Community Owned digital Preservation Tool Registry, <a href="http://coptr.digipres.org/">COPTR</a> has unified five isolated tool registries. It provides an easy-to-edit wiki interface where we can share our knowledge about, and experiences with, tools used for digital preservation purposes. If you create a new digipres tool, please [add it to COPTR](http://coptr.digipres.org/Guidelines_for_contributing_to_COPTR), but before you create a new tool, please use COPTR to find [similar ones](http://coptr.digipres.org/Category:Function) and see if you might be able to [extend or improve some of the existing tools]({{ site.baseurl }}/improving-our-tools/).
* Digital preservation needs high-quality tools, but to get high-quality tools, we need <a href="{{ baseurl }}/test-corpora/">rich and varied test corpora to stretch those tools to their limits</a>.
* Contributing to the development and improvement of tools is easy, even if you're not technical. Check out [this guide to making small documentation edits, or raising issues on Github](http://ablwr.github.io/blog/2014/11/03/non-technical-persons-guide-to-becoming-an-open-source-software-contributor-via-github/).


Understanding Formats
---------------------

We need to understand the file formats of the resources we care for, and the software they depend on.

* [Search for formats](/formats/)
* Add formats to the [File Formats Wiki](http://justsolve.archiveteam.org)
* Understand [file format risks](http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/TR/OPF+File+Format+Risk+Registry) ([e.g. JP2](http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/TR/JP2))
    * If you have good examples of digital resources and their risks, please consider adding them to <a href="{{ baseurl }}/real-data/">a test corpus</a>.
* [Enhance file format identification](fileformatid_main.html)
* Identify formats now with [FIDOO](http://www.techmaurice.com/fidoo/), [Siegfried](http://www.itforarchivists.com/siegfried) or [Interject](http://www.webarchive.org.uk/interject/inspect/)


Improving Identification
------------------------

Identifying file formats is the bread and butter of digital preservation characterisation and assessment. Identification tool coverage and accuracy could be much better, and this primarily comes down to the signatures, or file format "magic", used to identify each format. You can help contribute and make our identification tools more effective here:

* [Submit a file format signature/patch to Apache Tika](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA), [like this one](http://openpreservation.org/blogs/2012-02-09-basic-guide-writing-new-format-signatures).
* [Contribute a file format signature to DROID](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/submitinfo.htm). See [this guide](http://openpreservation.org/blogs/2012-02-09-basic-guide-writing-new-format-signatures) and [this official guide](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/pronom-file-signature-research.pdf).
* [Contribute a file format signature to FILE](https://github.com/glensc/file). See [this guide](http://www.openpreservation.org/blogs/2012-08-09-magic-editing-and-creation-primer).

If you want to start to put this into practice you can identify file formats right now (with no installation or setup) using [FIDOO](http://www.techmaurice.com/fidoo/) or alternatively check out stand alone [file format identification tools](http://www.digipres.org/tools/by-function/#ingest:fileformatidentification).
