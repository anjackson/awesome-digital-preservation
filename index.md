subtitle: Community-owned digital preservation resources
---

This site aims to provide a single gateway to all of the wonderful community-owned and community-oriented resources out there that are dedicated to digital preservation. The goal is to help the international digital preservation community to find eachother, to grow, and to find ways to support eachother. Crucially, we want to help pool our knowledge and resources so we can do more and better preservation, and try to avoid anyone re-inventing the wheel. Of course, this ethos also extends to this gateway site, so please [raise any issues (e.g. what have we missed?)](https://github.com/digipres/digipres.github.io/issues), [contribute to this web site](https://github.com/digipres/digipres.github.io), or [discuss your ideas with us](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/digipres).
