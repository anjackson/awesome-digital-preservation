Improving Identification Tools
------------------------------

Identifying file formats is the bread and butter of digital preservation characterisation and assessment. Identification tool coverage and accuracy could be much better, and this primarily comes down to the signatures used to identify each format.

* [Submit a file format signature/patch to Apache Tika](http://openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2012-02-09-basic-guide-writing-new-format-signatures)).
* [Contribute a file format signature to DROID](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/pronom-file-signature-research.pdf)).
* [Contribute a file format signature to FILE](http://www.openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2012-08-09-magic-editing-and-creation-primer)).


Characterisation/Metadata Extraction
------------------------------------

Deep file characterisation enables validation, identification of preservation risks and extraction of metadata. In developing a new characterisation capability, begin with thorough research to identify existing code to re-use or build on, develop a focused command line tool, then consider turning it into a JHOVE2 module.

Develop a new file characterisation capability and turn it into a [JHOVE2 module](https://bitbucket.org/jhove2/main/wiki/Home).
