* [Digital Preservation Business Case Toolkit](http://wiki.dpconline.org/index.php?title=Digital_Preservation_Business_Case_Toolkit)
* Write up your digital preservation needs, and get them solved
* Do you have an unsolved digital preservation challenge? Would you like someone to solve it for you? The [Open Planets Foundation wiki](/display/REQ/Digital+Preservation+and+Data+Curation+Requirements+and+Solutions "Digital Preservation and Data Curation Requirements and Solutions") captures information about specific Datasets or digital collections. These link to concrete digital preservation challenges or Issues. Once those Issues have been solved, they are written up as Solutions. Capturing the requirements of preservation practitioners enables developers to target their precious resources more effectively. [Sharing our experiences in solving preservation Issues allows others to learn from the successes (and less successful approaches)](http://openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2012-05-17-do-others-share-your-digital-preservation-challenges-and-know-about-best-solutions).
