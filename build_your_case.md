Start with the [Digital Preservation Business Case Toolkit](http://wiki.dpconline.org/index.php?title=Digital_Preservation_Business_Case_Toolkit), and use the [POWRR One Pagers](http://powrr-wiki.lib.niu.edu/index.php/One_Pagers_tailored_to_educate_different_professionals) to educate stakeholders about the issues.

Share your [challenges and solutions](http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/REQ/Digital+Preservation+and+Data+Curation+Requirements+and+Solutions) with the community, and view the resulting record of digital preservation practice.

Visual examples of digital preservation challenges, such as graphic corruption, can be incredibly useful in communicating the digital preservation message. That's why we built the Atlas of Digital Damages [Gallery](http://www.flickr.com/groups/2121762@N23/) and [website](http://www.atlasofdigitaldamages.info) -
