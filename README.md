- Engage Stakeholders:
    - Visual examples of digital preservation challenges, such as graphic corruption, can be incredibly useful in communicating the digital preservation message. That's why we built the Atlas of Digital Damages [Gallery](http://www.flickr.com/groups/2121762@N23/) and [website](http://www.atlasofdigitaldamages.info). Please add your own images of a digital preservation challenge, failed rendering, encoding damage, corrupt data, or visual evidence documenting to the Atlas of Digital Damages.
    - Use the [POWRR One Pagers](http://powrr-wiki.lib.niu.edu/index.php/One_Pagers_tailored_to_educate_different_professionals) to educate stakeholders about the issues.

## Real Data and Requirements

Real data, real challenges and real requirements make your and others digital preservation developments far more useful and effective.

- Test tools using publicly-available test corpora, and consider adding  or creating your own files to improve the corpora.
- Contribute to the [DP Requirements and Solutions wiki](http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/REQ/Digital+Preservation+and+Data+Curation+Requirements+and+Solutions)
- In order to improve our digital preservation capability, we need to be able to analyse and evaluate our work in an effective manner. For example, we need to be able to compare and contrast tools and approaches, and we need to see how changes over time affect performance. Practising what we preach in this field means sharing our data about digital preservation. [Share your digital preservation data using the Linked Data Simple Storage Specification](https://web-archive.southampton.ac.uk/lds3.org/). [Dave Tarrant explains why this is a good idea](https://openpreservation.org/blogs/years-registry-why-has-preservation-community-not-solved-problem-well-managed-and/).
- See also [Where are the Born-Digital Archives Test Data Sets?](https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2014/03/where-are-the-born-digital-archives-test-data-sets/)


## Test Corpora

To improve our digital preservation tools, we need to be able to test them and evaluate of their performance. Publicly available sample files make this much easier. Tool developers can use them to test their work, discover bugs, and hone their tools ready for others to use. A test corpus can contain real digital objects from a collection, or be created specifically for exhibiting certain characteristics for testing purposes. Real data, particularly with examples of broken, badly formed or corrupted files can be particularly useful.

### Building Corpora

If the existing corpora aren't cutting it, perhaps you can contribute to the OPF Format Corpus hosted on GitHub. There's a [guide here on how to contribute](http://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php/Collecting_format_ID_test_files) or you can [contact OPF](http://openpreservation.org/about/contact/) for help on how to get involved.

### Sourcing test files from web archives

Web archives can provide a useful source of files of particular formats. For example, [search via the UKWA interface](https://www.webarchive.org.uk/shine/search?page=1&invert=&facet.fields=crawl_year&invert=&invert=&facet.fields=public_suffix&invert=&invert=&invert=&invert=&invert=&query=content_type%3A%22application%2Fmbox%22&totalCount=totalCount&order=asc).

## Tools

Software tools give us the means the interrogate, manipulate, understand and ultimately preserve our digital data.

- Find tools to solve your challenges with the [POWRR Tools Grid](http://www.digipres.org/tools/)
- Contribute your experiences of using tools to the [COPTR wiki](http://coptr.digipres.org/)
    - The Community Owned digital Preservation Tool Registry, <a href="http://coptr.digipres.org/">COPTR</a> has unified five isolated tool registries. It provides an easy-to-edit wiki interface where we can share our knowledge about, and experiences with, tools used for digital preservation purposes. If you create a new digipres tool, please [add it to COPTR](http://coptr.digipres.org/Guidelines_for_contributing_to_COPTR), but before you create a new tool, please use COPTR to find [similar ones](http://coptr.digipres.org/Category:Function) and see if you might be able to extend or improve some of the existing tools.
- Contributing to the development and improvement of tools is easy, even if you're not technical. Check out [this guide to making small documentation edits, or raising issues on GitHub](http://ablwr.github.io/blog/2014/11/04/non-technical-persons-guide-to-becoming-an-open-source-software-contributor-via-github/).
- Digital preservation needs high-quality tools, but to get high-quality tools, we need test-corpora rich and varied test corpora to stretch those tools to their limits.


## Building Workflows

Resources to help build up preservation workflows, e.g. templates for how to use command-line tools, and how to chain things together.

- [ffmprovisr 'Making FFmpeg Easier'](http://amiaopensource.github.io/ffmprovisr/) (example of how to use `ffmpeg` to perform specific tasks)
- [AMIA Open Source: List of open workflows for A/V resources](https://github.com/amiaopensource/open-workflows)

## Understanding Formats

We need to understand the file formats of the resources we care for, and the software they depend on.

- [Search for formats](https://digipres.org/formats/)
- Add formats to the [File Formats Wiki](http://justsolve.archiveteam.org)
- Understand [file format risks](http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/TR/OPF+File+Format+Risk+Registry) ([e.g. JP2](http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/TR/JP2))
    - If you have good examples of digital resources and their risks, please consider adding them to a test corpus.
   [Siegfried](http://www.itforarchivists.com/siegfried) 

### Improving Identification

Identifying file formats is the bread and butter of digital preservation characterisation and assessment. Identification tool coverage and accuracy could be much better, and this primarily comes down to the signatures, or file format "magic", used to identify each format. You can help contribute and make our identification tools more effective here:

- [A basic guide for writing format signatures](http://openpreservation.org/blogs/2012-02-09-basic-guide-writing-new-format-signatures) - Covers [Apache Tika](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA) and [DROID](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/submitinfo.htm).
- [DROID/PRONOM also has this official guide](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/pronom-file-signature-research.pdf)
- [Contribute a file format signature to FILE](https://github.com/glensc/file) - See [this guide](http://www.openpreservation.org/blogs/2012-08-09-magic-editing-and-creation-primer).

If you want to start to put this into practice you can identify file formats right now (with no installation or setup) using [Siegfried JS](https://siegfried-js.glitch.me/) or alternatively check out stand alone [file format identification tools](http://www.digipres.org/tools/by-function/#ingest:fileformatidentification).


### Improving Characterisation/Metadata Extraction

Deep file characterisation enables validation, identification of preservation risks and extraction of metadata. In developing a new characterisation capability, begin with thorough research to identify existing code to re-use or build on, develop a focused command line tool, then consider turning it into a JHOVE module.

- Develop a new file characterisation capability and turn it into a [JHOVE module](http://jhove.openpreservation.org/documentation/dev-module/), or an [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) module.
