title: Test Corpora

Improving our digital preservation toolsets requires careful testing and evaluation of their performance. Sample  enables tool developers to easily try out their tools, discover bugs, and hone their tools ready for others to use. A test corpus can contain real digital objects from a collection, or be created specifically for exhibiting certain characteristics for testing purposes. Real data, particularly with examples of broken, badly formed or corrupted files can be particularly useful. For example, see <a href="https://github.com/openplanets/format-corpus/tree/master/jp2k-test">this JP2k test corpus</a>.

Share sample digital objects for a test corpus. <span class="nobr"><a href="https://github.com/openplanets/fo-corpus" class="external-link">Contribute to the OPF Format Corpus on Gitub</a></span> or <span class="nobr"><a href="https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B8ZzGhlaygesdzNfUnB3dkpQN28/edit" class="external-link">contribute to the OPF Format Corpus via Google drive</a></span>, with a <span class="nobr"><a href="http://wiki.curatecamp.org/index.php/Collecting_format_ID_test_files" class="external-link">guide here on how to contribute</a></span> or <span class="nobr"><a href="http://openplanetsfoundation.org/contact" class="external-link">contact OPF</a></span> for help on how to get involved.
