title: Formats

We need to understand the formats of the resources we care for, and the software they depend on. The [Just Solve The File Format Problem Wiki](http://justsolve.archiveteam.org) contains detailed information on hundreds of formats, and will welcome any contributions you can make. You could also consider contributing to and refine the contents of [UDFR](http://udfr.org/), which is a more formal linked data registry.

If you're interesting in understanding the file format risks you should be concerned about ([e.g. JP2](http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/TR/JP2)), you can refer to the [file format risks registry](http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/TR/OPF+File+Format+Risk+Registry). If you have good examples of digital resources and their risks, please consider adding them to <a href="{{ baseurl }}/test-corpora/">a test corpus</a>.

Identifying file formats is the bread and butter of digital preservation characterisation and assessment. Identification tool coverage and accuracy could be much better, and this primarily comes down to the signatures, or file format "magic", used to identify each format. You can help contribute and make our identification tools more effective here:

*	[Submit a file format signature/patch to Apache Tika](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TIKA), [like this one](http://openpreservation.org/blogs/2012-02-09-basic-guide-writing-new-format-signatures).
* [Contribute a file format signature to DROID](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/PRONOM/submitinfo.htm). See [this guide](http://openpreservation.org/blogs/2012-02-09-basic-guide-writing-new-format-signatures) and [this official guide](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/information-management/pronom-file-signature-research.pdf).
* [Contribute a file format signature to FILE](https://github.com/glensc/file). See [this guide](http://www.openpreservation.org/blogs/2012-08-09-magic-editing-and-creation-primer).

If you want to start to put this into practice you can identify file formats right now (with no installation or setup) using [FIDOO](http://www.techmaurice.com/fidoo/) or alternatively check out stand alone [file format identification tools](http://www.digipres.org/tools/by-function/#ingest:fileformatidentification).
