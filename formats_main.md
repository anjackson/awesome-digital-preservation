We need to understand the formats of the resources we care for, and the software they depend on. The [Just Solve The File Format Problem Wiki](http://justsolve.archiveteam.org) contains detailed information on hundreds of formats, and will welcome any contributions you can make. You could also consider contributing to and refine the contents of [UDFR](http://udfr.org/), which is a more formal linked data registry.

If you're interesting in understanding the file format risks you should be concerned about ([e.g. JP2](http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/TR/JP2)), you can refer to the [file format risks registry](http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/TR/OPF+File+Format+Risk+Registry). If you have good examples of digital resources and their risks, please consider adding them to <a href="{{ baseurl }}/test-corpora/">a test corpus</a>.
