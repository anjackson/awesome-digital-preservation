# Reminder Email

This page just holds the template for a reminder email, which we will send once per year (just ahead of World Digital Preservation Day) to the main digital preservation mailing lists, to remind people of the sites existence and purpose, and to encourage engagement with shared resources like format corpora and the Q&A site.

__Subject:__ Digital Preservation Community Resources: Request for feedback and call for contributions

Calling All Digital Preservers!

The digital preservation community is small and under resourced. This means we have to work together if we want to make the biggest impact. To this end, a small group of us have been attempting to help the members of the digital preservation community better support each other.  With World Digital Preservation Day just around the corner (<https://www.dpconline.org/events/world-digital-preservation-day>), we'd like to encourage you all to (re)discover what we've built so far:

* The <http://www.digipres.org> homepage, our community gateway and homepage.
* The _Digital Preservation Awesome List_ (<https://github.com/digipres/awesome-digital-preservation#readme>), aiming to be a comprehensive index of software and resources to help preserve digital content.
* The Digital Preservation Q&A site (<http://qanda.digipres.org/>), which is intended to make our questions and answers easier to find.
* The COPTR Tool Registry (<http://coptr.digipres.org>), which was formed by the merger of many of the previous tool registry efforts, and which seeks to be a primary reference for those working in practical digital preservation.
* The POWRR Tool Grid (<https://coptr.digipres.org/index.php/Tools_Grid>), which is generated from COPTR Tool Registry.
* The Open Preservation Format Corpus (<https://github.com/openpreserve/format-corpus>), where anyone can contribute example files.
* The Format Registry Aggregator (<http://www.digipres.org/formats/>), which aggregates information from a number of different format registries so you can search across them all at once.

If you'd like to help, we'd love to hear from you....

* What have we missed from the [Awesome List](https://github.com/digipres/awesome-digital-preservation#readme)? 
* Can you answer any of [the unanswered DigiPres questions](http://qanda.digipres.org/unanswered)? Do you need to ask questions of your own? Are there old questions and answers on mailing lists that need a more visible home, so others can find them again?
* Can you contribute to the [COPTR Tool Registry](http://coptr.digipres.org/)?
* Are these resources useful? Should we change our approach?

The last one is really important. We've been in digital preservation long enough to see a lot of portals and projects come and go, and we recognise that making it possible to build on past work sometimes requires changing what we've built so far.

Please get in touch if you have any questions. You could talk us directly, or use the [digipres.org discussion forums](https://github.com/orgs/digipres/discussions). We're happy to hear any and all ideas and criticisms!

In particular, in the last few weeks, the digipres.org homepage has been modified and the Awesome List has been set up, based on community feedback (<https://github.com/orgs/digipres/discussions/34>).  Now would be a _great_ time to get some feedback on what we've been doing!

Thanks for reading, and thanks to everyone who has contributed so far.


Best wishes,

Andy Jackson ([@anjacks0n](https://twitter.com/anjacks0n)) & Paul Wheatley ([@prwheatley](https://twitter.com/prwheatley)), on behalf of all the digipres.org contributors.

With thanks to [Open Preservation Foundation](https://openpreservation.org/) for hosting Q&A, COPTR and their format corpus, and to the [Digital Preservation Coalition](https://www.dpconline.org/) for their support.
