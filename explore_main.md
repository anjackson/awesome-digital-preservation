The <a href="http://qanda.digipres.org/">Digital Preservation Q&amp;A</a> site provide a space where anyone can ask questions and receive answers from other members of the digital preservation community.

Discussion [forums](https://groups.google.com/forum/forum/digital-curation) and active [blogs](http://openplanetsfoundation.org/) provide the opportunity to share informal advice and war stories, get recommendations and discuss the finer points of digital preservation. By sharing both your intentions for digital preservation work and your results, you can [ensure your work benefits from a wealth of community experience](http://openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2012-05-17-do-others-share-your-digital-preservation-challenges-and-know-about-best-solutions).

In order to improve our digital preservation capability, we need to be able to analyse and evaluate our work in an effective manner. For example, we need to be able to compare and contrast tools and approaches, and we need to see how changes over time affect performance. Practising what we preach in this field means sharing our data about digital preservation.Â [Dave Tarrant explains why this is a good idea](http://openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2012-08-29-years-registry-why-has-preservation-community-not-solved-problem-well-managed-and).
