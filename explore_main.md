The <a href="http://qanda.digipres.org/">Digital Preservation Q&amp;A</a> site provide a space where anyone can ask questions and receive answers from other members of the digital preservation community.

Discussion [forums](https://groups.google.com/forum/forum/digital-curation) and active [blogs](http://openplanetsfoundation.org/) provide the opportunity to share informal advice and war stories, get recommendations and discuss the finer points of digital preservation. By sharing both your intentions for digital preservation work and your results, you can [ensure your work benefits from a wealth of community experience](http://openplanetsfoundation.org/blogs/2012-05-17-do-others-share-your-digital-preservation-challenges-and-know-about-best-solutions).

For material that describes the broader issues, you can refer to [Digital Preservation on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_preservation), and consider contributing to the [Digital Preservation Wikipedia Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Digital_Preservation).
