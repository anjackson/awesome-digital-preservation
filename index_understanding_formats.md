Everyone knows we need a decent file format registry to support digital preservation activities, but we'll need to work together to document the formats we care for, and the software they depend on. So far, the most successful crowdsourced effort has been the [Just Solve The File Format Problem Wiki](http://justsolve.archiveteam.org), so please add your knowledge and experience there. You could also consider contributing to and refine the contents of [UDFR](http://udfr.org/), which is a more formal linked data registry.

If you're interesting in understanding the file format risks you should be concerned about, you can refer to the
[file format risks registry](http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/TR/OPF+File+Format+Risk+Registry) ([see e.g. this excellent JP2 risks page](http://wiki.opf-labs.org/display/TR/JP2 "JP2")).

Digital preservation needs high-quality tools, but to get high-quality tools, we need rich and varied test corpora to stretch those tools to their limits. <a href="{{ baseurl }}/test-corpora/">Click here to find out more about the available corpora and how to use and contribute to them</a>.
