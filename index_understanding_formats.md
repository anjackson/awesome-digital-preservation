The <a href="http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/">File Formats Wiki</a>.

* Everyone knows we need a decent file format registry to support digital preservation activities. But so far most of our registries are pretty empty.
* [Just solve the File Format Problem: Contribute to the crowd sourced file format information wiki on the Archive Team site](http://justsolve.archiveteam.org).
* [Add a new format risks and solutions page to the OPF wiki](/display/TR/OPF+File+Format+Risk+Registry "OPF File Format Risk Registry") ([like this excellent JP2 risks page](/display/TR/JP2 "JP2")).

 File format risks you should be concerned about, and how to identify them in your content
* Share or create digital object samples - Improving our digital preservation toolsets requires careful testing and evaluation of their performance. Sample data enables tool developers to easily try out their tools, discover bugs, and hone their tools ready for others to use. A test corpus can contain real digital objects from a collection, or be created specifically for exhibiting certain characteristics for testing purposes. Real data, particularly with examples of broken, badly formed or corrupted files can be particularly useful. For example, see this [JP2k test corpus](https://github.com/openplanets/format-corpus/tree/master/jp2k-test).

* Digital preservation needs high-quality tools, but to get high-quality tools, we need rich and varied test corpora to stretch those tools to their limits. <a href="{{ baseurl }}/test-corpora/">Click here to find out more about the available corpora and how to use and contribute to them</a>.
